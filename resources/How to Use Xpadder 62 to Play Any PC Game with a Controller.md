In this article, we will show you how to use Xpadder 62 to play any PC game with a controller, even if the game does not support it natively. You will need a compatible game controller (such as an Xbox 360 or PS3 controller), a USB cable or wireless adapter to connect it to your PC, and a copy of Xpadder 62. You can download Xpadder 62 from the official website for only $9.99 USD.
 
## Step 1: Install Xpadder 62
 
After downloading Xpadder 62 from the official website[^1^], run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to allow the program to make changes to your device. Once installed, launch Xpadder 62 from your desktop or start menu.
 
## Step 2: Connect Your Controller
 
Plug in your controller to your PC using a USB cable or a wireless adapter. Xpadder 62 should automatically detect your controller and show it on the main screen. If not, click on the controller icon at the top left corner and select "New..." from the drop-down menu. You will see a blank controller image where you can assign buttons and sticks.
 
## Step 3: Assign Buttons and Sticks
 
To assign buttons and sticks, simply click on the corresponding area on the controller image and press the button or move the stick on your controller. You will see a pop-up window where you can choose what keyboard key or mouse button action you want to map to that button or stick. You can also adjust the sensitivity, dead zone, turbo mode, rumble mode and other settings for each button or stick.
 
For example, if you want to map the A button on your Xbox 360 controller to the spacebar on your keyboard (which is usually used for jumping in most games), click on the A button on the controller image and press the A button on your controller. Then select "Keyboard" from the pop-up window and press the spacebar on your keyboard. You will see "Space" appear next to the A button on the controller image.
 
You can repeat this process for all the buttons and sticks you want to assign. You can also use combinations, sequences, toggles, triggers, shift sets and multiple controllers for more advanced mapping options. For more details on how to use these features, please refer to the Xpadder 62 manual or visit the official website[^1^].
 
## Step 4: Save Your Profile
 
Once you are done assigning buttons and sticks, you can save your profile for future use. Click on the file icon at the top left corner and select "Save As..." from the drop-down menu. Give your profile a name (such as "Xpadder 62 Generic") and choose a location where you want to save it. You can also add an image of your controller or game logo for easy identification.
 
You can create multiple profiles for different games or controllers and switch between them easily by clicking on the file icon and selecting "Open..." from the drop-down menu. You can also assign hotkeys to load profiles quickly without opening Xpadder 62.
 
## Step 5: Launch Your Game
 
Now that you have created and saved your profile, you are ready to play any PC game with a controller. Launch your game as usual and enjoy using your controller instead of keyboard and mouse. Xpadder 62 will run in the background and translate your controller inputs into keyboard and mouse actions.
